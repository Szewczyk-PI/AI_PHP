# AI_PHP
Hello there
This is my small project that aims to improve cv with the help of AI.
The program is to analyze the submitted cv and with the help of a scrap of a given offer is to give the best possible cv.
So far the results are moderately satisfactory rather this is due to the use of Llama3 as an assystent.
The main goals to improve:
1. enable uploading CVs in PDF format.
2. improve the results with resume segmentation.
3. change and/or enable selection of LLMs
